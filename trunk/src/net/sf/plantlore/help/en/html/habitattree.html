  <h1>The habitat tree</h1>
 <p>The purpose of the habitat tree is to make your orientation in the occurrences a little easier.
You can invoke it from the main application toolbar.

 <p>The first level of the tree contains territories. Each territory then contains phytochoria and
 each phytochorion contains a list of habitats. The tree contains only those phytochoria and territories
 for that already some occurrence exists in the database. Phythochoria that don't contain any habitats are not displayed.
 Similarly territories that don't contain at least one phytochorion containing at least one habitat are also not displayed.
 Each phytochorion contains all habitats in that phytochorion (even though the user may have used different
 territories).
</p>
  
  <p>You can display occurrences in a given habitat by double clicking it or by selecting it and then
  invoking the search action from a context menu or by pressing the tree's Search button.
</p>
   
   <p>The tree doesn't refresh itself as you work with the database to make the work more effective
   on slower internet connections. The list of habitats is loaded (refreshed) from the database
   each time you expand node of the particular phytochorion. To load the entire structure of the tree
   use the refresh button or the refresh action from the context menu.
