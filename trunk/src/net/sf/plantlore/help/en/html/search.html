<h1>Searching in occurrence data</h1>
<p>The search dialog resembles add and edit dialogs a lot, but also differs in a few ways.
It is not possible to add taxons from the checklist. On the other hand you can set either
month or time interval for searching.</p>

<p>The search dialog opens empty every time. In case you leave it empty and click
 straight on the Ok button then a list of all occurrences will be displayed in the
<a href="overview.html">Overview</a>. So now we've just described a way to return
to all occurrences in the Overview.</p>

<p>It is possible to fill in any combination of the displayed items. The dialog
only won't let you enter wrong values such as words where it expects numbers, or
 you can't enter month and time interval at the same time.</p>

<h2>Adding of authors, their roles and notes</h2>
<p>You can add the author, role or the note the same way as in the add and edit dialogs.
Click on the Add button in the upper left part of the basic form. New row appears.
You can fill in the author's name, role or her note.
The only tricky thing might be that if you add multiple rows and fill in different authors
 roles or notes all these items will be added to the query using the OR conjuction.
Here is a little example. You add the first row and fill in "Mosgaard" as the author and "collect"
as the role. Then you add the second row and fill in "Kroghshoj" and "revised" as the role. 
If you then click the Ok button then occurrences whose author is either Mosgaard or Kroghshoj are displayed
as well as occurrences in that some of the authors has role collect or role revised.</p>

<h2>How is the query constructed</h2>
<p>We've already described the way the query is created in the case of authors, roles and 
the notes of authors. The rest is quite straightforward. In case you add one or more taxons,
let's say a Camomile and a Dandelion then occurrences of either of these plants are searched for.
In other words taxons are connected by the OR conjuction. </p>
<p>The other itmes are connected to the query using the AND conjuction. Let's say
you enter Camomile and Dandelion as taxons and Bohemia centralis as territory.
Then after clicking on the Ok button occurrences of Camomiles in Bohemia centralis and
occurrences of Dandelions in Bohemia centralis are displayed in the <a href="overview.html">Overview</a></p>
<p>One more thing worth mentioning is searching in the notes. When searching in notes
the application looks for substrings in the notes in the database. That means if you
enter the word "meadow" to the Place description text area and then click on Ok then
 all occurrences with the string "meadow" in their Place descritption will be displayed.
 The same way it works when searching in the occurrence or location note.</p>
