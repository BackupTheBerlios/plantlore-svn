  <h1>Occurrence Data Export</h1>
  	<p>
	Your Occurrence data are stored in a database and
	cannot be accessed directly. In order to transfer your
	data from one computer to another, you must use Export and
	<a href="./import.html">Import</a>. 
	Export allows you to "take" the Occurrence data from the database
	and store them into a file on your hard drive.
	</p>

	<p>
	Export can be performed in every database after logging in - even in a remote database.
	However, if you are connected to a remote database and want to export the Occurrence data,
	you should take the capacity of the network connection you are using into account, because
	the amount of data transfered via the network may be huge and the whole process
	may be painfully slow.
	</p>

	<p>
	There can run only one Export at a time.

	<h2>1. What has to be done before Export is started</h2>

	<p>
	First, you have to select some Occurrences in the <a href="./overview.html">Overview</a>.
	In order to reduce the amount of records from which you choose, use <a href="./search.html">Search</a>.
	If you don't select any record, Plantlore acts as if all records were selected saving you
	the time to select them all by yourself.
	</p>

	<p>
	You can see 11 records that are about to be exported in the picture below.

	<h2>2. Exporting the Occurrence data</h2>

	<p>
	Export of the Occurrence data takes two steps.
	</p>

	<h3>2.1. File name and file format specification</h3>

	<p>
	Type in the name of the file and choose its format from the list of basic formats: 
	<ul>
		<li>
		PlantloreNative is a format designed for the transfer of Occurrence data
		between two Plantlore programs. 
		If you are unsure which format you should choose we recommend this one.
		</li>
		<li>
		XML is a format based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML). 
		The Occurrences are stored in a well-defined tree structure. 
		This format allows you to specify what attributes of the records you are interested in. 
		This format is less suitable for the data transfer 
		but very good for their visualization in the Internet Explorer, for instance.  
		</li>
		<li>
		ABCD Schema is another XML based format. 
		However, the structure is different and conforms to the ABCD Schema requirements.
		</li>
		<li>
		DarwinCore is another XML based format. 
		Its structure conforms to the DarwinCore requirements.
		</li>
		<li>
		CSV - known as Comma Separated Values - is a simple format 
		that contains one Occurrence per line. 
		Values of attributes of the record are separated by commas. 
		The first line contains the names of those attribues. 
		The structure of the file therefore resembles a table, 
		which is particularly suitable for table processors, such as Microsoft Excel.  
		</li>
		<li>
		StdOut doesn't store the records in a file 
		but sends them into the standard output. 
		The records are parsed and sent in a very legible form: 
		table.column = value. 
		This "format" is intented for stream processing in a command line.  
		</li>
	</ul>
	If you are unsure which format to choose, 
	we recommend to use the PlantloreNative which is most suitable for the data transfer.
	</p>

	<h3>2.2. Records' Attributes Selection (optional)</h3>

	<p>
	This step is optional. Only XML, CSV and StdOut support this option. 
	The other formats export the records with all their attributes.  
	You can select the desired attributes by clicking on them in the tree. 
	The attributes displayed in red are compulsory if you are planning to 
	<a href="./import.html">Import</a> the data back into Plantlore. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you do not select any column, Plantlore acts as if all were selected. 
	</p>

	</p>


	<h3>2.3. The export</h3>

	<p>
	After the selection of attributes if completed, export is started. 
	You can follow the progress in a small window. 
	If you decide to cancel the export, click on the "Cancel" button and
	export will be ended immediately. The file will contain the Occurrence data
	that were written before the operation was canceled. It is guaranteed that the
	format of the file is valid even if export is terminated prematurely either by
	the User or by an error.
