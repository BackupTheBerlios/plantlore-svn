	<h1>Export of the Occurrence Data</h1>

	<p>
	Your Occurrence data are stored in the Plantlore's database.
	This database cannot be accessed directly. 
	If you want to transfer your data to other computers, you will have to use the Export.
	Export allows you to "take" the occurrence data from the database 
	and store them in a file on your hard drive.
	</p>

	<p>
	The Export can be conducted with any database after logging in - even with a remote database.
	If you are connected to a remote database and want to export some occurrence data,
	bear in mind that the total amount of data may flood the transfer capacity and the whole
	process may become painfully slow.
	</p>

	<p>
	You have to take several steps to Export your data.
	These steps are described in detail below.
	</p>


	<h2>Before you will start exporting the data</h2>

	<p>
	It is necessary to search/select some Occurrence data before you start exporting them.
	You can do it in the <a href="./search.html">Search</a> dialog.
	You must fill in the desired criteria - let's say, you want to search all occurrence data
	related to a certain project in a certain year.
	All relevant occurrence data in the database will be displayed 
	in the <a href="./overview.html">Overview</a> 
	
	You can explicitly select some of these records. If you leave the selection empty
	(ie. if you select no record at all) Plantlore will act as if you selected them all.
	This feature should greatly simplify the Export of all records.
	</p>


	<h2>The Export</h2>

	<p>
	Exporting the occurrence data involves three steps:
	</p>

	<h3>1. Specifying the name of the file and its format</h3>

	<p>
	Type in the name of the file and choose its format
	from the list of several basic formats:
	<ul>
		<li>PlantloreNative is a format designed for a convenient transfer of occurrence
		data among many Plantlore programs. If you don't know, which format you should choose,
		we recommend this one.
		</li>
		<li>XML is a format relying on the Extensible Markup Language (XML).
		The occurrence data is stored in a well-arranged tree structure.
		This format allows you to specify which attributes of the records you are
		interested in. This format is suitable for data transfer as well as their visualization
		in the Internet Explorer, for instance.
		</li>
		<li>ABCD Schema is a XML based format. However, the structure is different and conforms
		to the ABCD Schema requirements.
		</li>
		<li>DarwinCore is a XML based format. Its structure is different and conforms
		to the DarwinCore requirements.
		</li>
		<li>CSV - known as Comma Separated Values - is a simple format that contains 
		one occurrence per line. Values of attributes of the record are separated by commas.
		The first line contains the names of those attribues.
		The structure of the file therefore resembles a table, and this format is particularly
		suitable for table processors, such as Microsoft Excel.
		</li>
		<li>StdOut doesn't store the records in a file but sends them into the standard output.
		The records are parsed and sent in a very legible form: table.column = value.
		
		This "format" is intented for stream processing in a command line or a shell, such
		as bash on Linux or PowerShell on Windows.
		</li>
	</ul>
	If you are unsure which format to choose, we recommend you use the PlantloreNative
	which is most suitable for both data transfer and visualization.

	<h3>2. Selecting records' attributes</h3>

	<p>
	This step is optional. Only the XML, CSV and StdOut support this option.
	The other formats export the record with all its attributes.
	<br/>
	You can specify the desired attributes by selecting them in the tree.
	The attributes marked red are compulsory if you are planning to
	<a href="./import.html">Import</a> the exported data back into Plantlore.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If you do not select any column, Plantlore acts as if you selected them all.

	</div>


	<h3>3. The Export</h3>

	<p>
	After the selection of attributes if completed, the Export starts.
	You can follow the progress in the window.
	Closing the window won't abort the procedure, it will just hide the window.
	The window can be re-opened if you click on the Export in the main menu -
	that is, if the Export wasn't completed yet.
	</p>

	<p>
	You can cancel the Export by clicking the "Abort" button.

	<h2>Restrictions and limits</h2>

	<p>
	You can export any selected occurrence data.
	Remember: "nothing means everyting" - if you do not explicitly select some records or attributes,
	Plantlore automatically assumes, that you wanted to select them all.
	</p>

	<p>
	There can run only one Export at a time.
