  <h1>Occurrence Data Import</h1>

	<p>
        Your Occurrence data are stored in a database and
	cannot be accessed directly. In order to transfer your
	data from one computer to another, you must use 
        <a href="./export.html">Export</a> and Import.
	
        Import allows you to "take" the Occurrence data from a file on your
        hard drive and store them back into your database.
	</p>

	<p>
        Import can be performed with every database after logging in - even with a remote database.
	However, if you are connected to a remote database and want to import the Occurrence data,
	you should take the capacity of the network connection you are using into account, because
	the amount of data transfered via the network may be huge and the whole process
	may be painfully slow.
	</p>

	<p>
        The database gets modified during the Occurrence data import.
        In order to prevent unauthorized modifications of the data, you have
        to posses sufficient access rights.
        For instance, if you do not have the right to add new records,
        Occurrence import would never succeed.
        To learn more about access rights see
        <a href="./user.html">User's rights</a>.

	<h2>1. Occurrence Import</h2>

	<p>
        First, you must specify the name of the file where the Occurrence
        records are stored. Currently only the PlantloreNative file format
        based on XML is available.
	</p>

	<p>
        After the file name is supplied, the Occurrence Import begins. 
        You can monitor its progress in the small window and cancel it by
        pressing the Cancel button.
        If you cancel the import prematurely, the Occurrences that were 
        already inserted will remain in the database.
        Should you wish to remove these records, use
	<a href="./history.html">History</a>,
	that can restore the database's previous state.
	</p>


	<h2>2. Occurrence Import in Detail</h2>

	<p>
        Occurrence import is a long running operation that modifies the contents
        of the database. Plantlore must make sure that neither integrity nor security
        of Occurrence records, that are already in the database, is violated,
        which is why Plantlore may reject some of the Occurrence data. 
        There are several reasons that may lead to rejection of a record:
	<ol>
		<li>
                Insufficient access rights - for instance you may not have the 
                right to add new records or modify records created by other Users.
		Learn more about user rights in Section
                <a href="./user.html">User management</a>.
		</li>

		<li>
                Incomplete record, i.e. record whose mandatory columns are missing.
		</li>

		<li>
                Incorrect record, i.e. record whose parts cannot be found in
                the database. It is not possible to insert an Occurrence record
                that refers to a plant, nearest bigger seat, phytochorion, or territorium
                that is not in the database already.
                The reasons why it is not possible are listed in Section
		<a href="./table_import.html">Table import</a>.
		</li>
	</ol>
        The previous list names all reasons that lead to rejection of an Occurrence
        record, but do not cancel the whole Import.
        If the file containing the Occurrence data has an unknown or invalid
        format, the Import is automatically canceled as if the Cancel button was
        pressed.
	</p>  


	<p>
        Export and Import were designed for an easy data transfer and exchange 
        between two databases. You can use Plantlore at home and at work 
        simultaneously - changes made at work can be easily projected into
        the database at home using the Export/Import procedure.
        Let's give an example. You create a new habitat, say 
        "50 metres from the Thames river.", and add two plants - 
        Rubus saxatilis L. and Caltha palustris.
        You export those two records and bring them to work where you import them
        into your database. At work you realize that one of the plants was not
	Rubus saxatilis L but Rubus albocarpaticus and you 
	<a href="./addoccurrence.html">update</a>
        the Occurrence record. If you transfer the data back to you home database,
        the change will happen there, too.
