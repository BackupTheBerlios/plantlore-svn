  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>The center of Plantlore is the overview. You see it after a successful login and you can invoke
  most of the Plantlore features from it.

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p> The overview is a table containing a list of occurrences. By default you see all the occurrences
    divided to multiple pages. You can narrow the list of occurrences down by using the <a href="search.html">Search</a>.
     </p>
    
    <p>The result of the search is always displayed in the overview. To return back to the all results you can click on the refresh button
in the right bottom part of the main application window.</p>
    
    <p>The overview doesn't refresh itself automatically. The reason is the effectivity of work on slower internet connections. 
    If you want to refresh the overview, you can either make a new search or use the Refresh button.</p>

    <p>You can change the numbor of occurrences displayed on a page by changing the number between the Previous and Next buttons.
    The page size changes after you confirm the number for example by pressing the Enter key. As of now it is NOT POSSIBLE to
    determine the page size dynamically according to the size of the window (technical reasons). The page size is restricted to 1000 occurrences.
    </p>
    
    <p>To delete, print or export you first need to check the desired occurrences by clicking on the initially leftmost column called "X".
    To select occurrences you can also use the All, None and Invert buttons in the lower left part of the window.
    <b>WARNING:</b> these three selecting buttons always work only with the current page. 
    After you have selected the occurrence you just have to invoke some plantlore function from the toolbar, menu or using a shortcut.
</p>

    <h2>3. Sorting</h2>
    <p>The overview supports only limited ways of sorting. By default the occurrences appear sorted by year from the most current one back to history.
You can also sort the occurrences on the current page. You can't sort all the occurrences in the database because of the (potentially) big number
of records in the database that could have enormous demands on connection speed and processing. 
Let's say you want to sort the occurrences by taxon name. You have to click on the Taxon column header. Then in the header an arrow shows up which
indicates the sorting direction. Secondary sorting is also possible - again clicking on a column header but this time with the Ctrl key pressed.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>4. Column order</h2>
    <p>It is possible to change the order of the columns in overview. You can do that either by simply dragging the column to a different place(which won't
    persist to the next time you run PLantlore) or by choosing the order in the Plantlore <a href="settings.html">Settings</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Occurrence details</h2>
    <p>The occurrence table doesn't show all information about the occurrence. You can tak a look at them either in the edit dialog or in a special
Detail dialog. You can invoke the Detail dialog by double clicking or pressing Enter on the desired occurrence.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="picture/overview_detail.png" alt="Occurrence detail"><br>
    
    <p>The detail allows for skipping to a next or previous occurence. It also shows information about the user that created the occurrence or who edited it the last time.</p>
