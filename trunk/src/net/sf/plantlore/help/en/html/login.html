  <h1>Database login and logout</h1>


  	<p>
	Before you start working with Plantlore, 
        it is necessary to connect to the database you would like to work with.

	<h2>1. The connection process</h2>

	<p>
	The process has two steps:
	</p>

	<h3>1.1. Selecting the database</h3>
	
	<p>
	<img src="picture/LoginDBSelection.png" alt="Database Selection.">
	</p>

	<p>
	After installing Plantlore you have two options 
        depending on how you would like to use Plantlore:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Create new database on your system</b> - You can create new database using menu 
                Data|Create new database. See Create database section for further information on how 
                to create new database.
            </li>
            <li><b>Connect to an already existing database</b> - In this case you need to create new database record
                with information about the database. 
                Information on creating new database records is included in this help section.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
	<p>
	After some time your list of databases can be similar to the one at the picture. 
        Plantlore will automatically select database you've 
        chosen during the previous session. 
        Choose one of the databases from the list and press
        the Continue button.
	</p>


	<h3>1.2. Authentication</h3>

	<p>
	For gaining access to the database you have to provide your 
        username and password in order to authenticate.
        If you are logging in for the first time, 
        use login name and password you have chosen when installing Plantlore.

        For security reasons, new user name and password can only be assigned 
        by an Administrator. Weak passwords are often
        used even by experienced users, therefore the assignment 
        of passwords is left to the Administrator.
      	</p>
	
	<p>
	<img src="picture/LoginAuthentication.png" alt="Specifying the login data.">
	</p>

	<p>
        Plantlore remembers several recently used login names; you can choose 
        one from the list or
        provide a different one. Plantlore doesn't save passwords 
        and doesn't offer them automatically.
        After you provide the authentication data, press the Login button.
	</p>

	<p>
        After pressing the Login button, Plantlore will try to connect to 
        the selected database
        using your authentication data. The connection can take some time, 
        especially if you are connecting
        to a remote database.
	</p>


	<p>
	In case the login fails for some reason, you will be 
        notified by a short message. Otherwise Plantlore 
        will display the basic <a href="./overview.html">Overview</a>.
	</p>


	<h2 id="AddDBInfo">2. creating database records</h2>

	<p>
	If you wish to connect to a different database than the one you 
        (or someone else) created on your computer,
        you have to create new record describing the database, 
        its location and settings.
	</p>

	<p>
        The context menu allowing you to add, edit or delete a record 
        is accessible via the right mouse click.
	Choose Add record and click on it.
	</p>

	<p>
	<img src="picture/LoginAddMenu.png" alt="Adding new Record.">
	</p>

	<p>
        The database description is divided into two parts.
	<ul>
		<li>
                The first option is the
                
		<b>Direct Connection</b>, also Local Connection. 
                The direct connection to the database can be used in case
                the database is located in a database engine that runs on the
                same computer as the client.
                
                The most visible advantage of the local connection is its speed -
                the communication with the database does not have to be processed
                for the network transfer.
		</li>
		<li>
                The second option is the 
		<b>Remote Connection</b>.
                A remote database is stored within a database engine that runs
                on a different computer in the network. 
                Thus you can work with a database remotely.
                
                The price you have to pay is that the data must be processed
                in order to be able to send them via the network. Also the network
                connection has its limits and work with the database remotely
                may be painfully slow if the capacity of the network connection
                is small.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>


	<h3>A. Direct Connection</h3>

	<p>
        The direct connection requires the following parameters:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Meaning</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Alias</td>
			<td>
                                Alias is a short string that will be presented to the User.
                                It allows fast and simple recongition of the database by the User.
                                The string should be brief.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Database engine</td>
			<td>
				There is a wide variety of database engines that
                                allow you to work with databases, tables, users, 
                                queries and data very easily.
                                Every database engine can store several different
                                databases - databases with different structure and
                                contents. The best known database engines are
                                Oracle, MSSQL, MySQL, Postgre and Firebird.
                                Plantlore can work with some of these database
                                engines, but it is necessary to specify with
                                which it should work so that the Program can communicate
                                with it properly. Plantlore is delivered 
                                and tested with Postgre.

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>DB Identifier</td>
			<td>
                                The database engine may contain several different 
                                databases with different structure and contents.
                                Databases that Plantlore works with have their own
                                specific structure. So as to know to which database
                                you would like to connect, you must specify 
                                its identifier within the database engine.
                                The identifier is usually a short name.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>DB Port</td>
			<td>
				Database engines can be contacted on a certain port.
                                Every database engine may have a different port number.
                                In order to know where to contact the database engine,
                                you have to supply the port where the database engine listens.
                                
                                Port is a number from 0 to 65.535 and ports above
                                1.024 are commonly used. Lower ports are usually
                                reserved for well known services (such as FTP, HTTP, etc.).
                                
                                The default port of PostgreSQL database engine is 5432.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Parameter</td>
			<td>
				The database engine may require some additional settings.
                                For instance you have to set the encoding explicitly.
                                This parameter is used to the proper additional configuration
                                of the database connection.
                                
                                Postgre does not require any additional parameter.
				<br/>
				<i>Note: the parameter is a value passed in the JDBC connections
                                string right after the exclamation mark "?"</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	</p>

	<p>
        In the picture there you can see how the local connection may look like.
        We are connecting to the database called "plantloreOK"
        that is stored within the database engine
	"PostgreSQL" that listens on the port "5432".
        There is no additional paramater.

	<h3>B. Remote Connection</h3>

	<p>
	Parameters required for the remote connection - to the remote Plantlore
        Server in this case. It is the Server that will mediate the creation
        of the connection:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Name</th>
			<th>Meaning</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Alias</td>
			<td>
				Alias is a short string that will be presented to the User.
                                It allows fast and simple recongition of the database by the User.
                                The string should be brief.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Host</td>
			<td>
				This parameter identifies the computer where the Server
                                is running - either by its name or IP address.
                                Every computer connected to a network must have its
                                own unique IP address so that it can be identified
                                in the network.
                                IP address is a sequence of four numbers separated with
                                dots, for instance "192.168.0.247". Some computers may have
                                also a name, such as "data.home.net".
                                
                                You can use both ways to identify the remote computer.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Port</td>
			<td>
				The port specifies where the remote Server listens.
                                
                                Port is a number from 0 to 65.535 and ports above
                                1.024 are commonly used. Lower ports are usually
                                reserved for well known services (such as FTP, HTTP, etc.).

				The default port is 1099.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>DB identifier</td>
			<td>
				The database engine may contain several different 
                                databases with different structure and contents.
                                Databases that Plantlore works with have their own

        Let us see how the remote connection parameters may look like.
        In the picture there you can see that we are connecting to a remote database
	named  "plantlore" that is stored within a database engine that is located
	on a computer with IP address "86.42.59.39" and the
	Plantlore Server listens on the port "1099".

	<p>
	<b>
            If you add a new record, no database is created; merely a reference to
            an already existing database is created.
	</b>
	</p>



	<h2>3. Editing and Deleting records</h2>

	<p>
        In the list of databases select the record you wish to update or delete.
        Use the context menu (accessible via the right mouse click) and 
        select Edit or Remove and click on it.

	<p>
        If you are updating (editing) an existing record, the dialog is the
        same as the Add dialog, but this one contains pre-filled values.
        The detailed description of all parameters is in the previous section.
	</p>

	<p>
	There are no additional settings when deleting a record.
	</p>

	<p>
	<b>
            If you delete an existing record, no database is actually delete.
            It is merely the reference to some database that is lost.
	</b>
	</p>



	<h2>4. Most common mistakes</h2>

	<p>
        The most common problems encountered during the login process are:
	<ol>
		<li>
                Incorrect authentication information. Either the username does not
                exist or the password is wrong. Please verify that both
                the account name (user name) exists and the password is correct.
		</li>
		<li>
                Incorrect parameters for direct or remote connection. 
                Please make sure that all necessary parameters are specified
                and that contain up-to-date data.
                For instance the IP address of the computer might have changed
                or you might have misspelled the database identifier.
		</li>
		<li>
                The database engine or the Plantlore Server is not running.
                Please make sure that the database engine and/or the Plantlore
                Server are running.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</p>



	<h2>5. Logging out</h2>

	<p>
        After you finish your work with the database we strongly recommecd that
        you disconnect from the database so that a third person is prevented from
        accessing your data. You can disconnect from the database either by 
        clicking on Menu|Logout or by closing the Planlore. Both ways are equal.
	</p>


	<h2>6. Renewal of the lost connection</h2>

	<p>
        The connection to the database or to the remote Server may be lost
        during the work. There are many reasons: the database engine or Server
        might have crashed or might have been switched off by their Administators,
        or the network connection might have been lost.
        After the problem is detected, you are notified by a short message describing
        the problem. In case you lose the connection, wait for a while, and then try 
        Menu|Reconnect. The Plantlore Client will try to renew the lost connection.
        You can call the Reconnect several times.
