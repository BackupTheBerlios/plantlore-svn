<h1>Author manager</h1>
Author manager allows users to add, search, modify and delete authors of the occurrence records.
It can be invoked by <strong>Data|Author Manager</strong>.
<p/>
The Author Manager window consists of two main parts:
<ul>
    <li><strong>The list of authors</strong> - where the results of the search are displayed</li>
    <li><strong>The search criteria</strong> - where you can specify search parameters</li>    
</ul>
<h3>The list of authors</h3>
After a succcessful search results are displayed in the list of authors, although not all of them can
be seen immediately. Initially, only the first page of the results is displayed. To see the rest
of the pages use <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Previous</strong> buttons which can be found 
directly under the list.
<p/>
This part also includes buttons for adding, editing and deleting authors. The <strong>Add</strong> and
<strong>Edit</strong> buttons open the Add/Edit Author Dialog (see below), the <strong>Delete</strong>
button removes the author after the confirmation. When <strong>Edit</strong> or </strong>Delete</strong>
button is pressed, an author must be selected in the list in order to proceed with the operation.
<h3>The search criteria</h3>
Author manager allows users to search the data using 4 parameters: name, organization, role and
email. Results can be ordered by name, organization, role, email, phone number and URL in either 
ascending or descending direction. Search string for any of the parameters doesn't have to match 
the item in the database exactly and any substring will be sufficient (although it might yield more 
results).
<p/>
The search is by default case insensitive.
<p/>
After the manager window is opened, all available authors are displayed. If you've executed a search
but you want to display and browse all available authors again, press the <strong>Search</strong>
button while all of the search fields are left blank.
<p/>
<h2>Adding new author</h2>
Window for adding new authors can be opened from the main Author Manager window using <string>Add 
author</strong> button. This window contains the following fields:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> - Whole name of the author. This field is compulsory and cannot be left blank.</li>
