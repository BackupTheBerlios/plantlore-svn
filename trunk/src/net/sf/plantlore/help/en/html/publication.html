<h1>Publication manager</h1>
Publication manager allows users to add, search, modify and delete publications where the occurrence records were published.
It can be invoked from menu <strong>Data|Publication Manager</strong>.
<p/>
The Publication Manager window consists of two main parts:
<ul>
    <li><strong>The list of publications</strong> - where the results of the search are displayed</li>
    <li><strong>The search criteria</strong> - where you can specify search parameters for publications</li>    
</ul>

<h3>The list of publications</h3>
After a succcessful search results are displayed in the list of publications, although not all of them can
be seen immediately. Initially, only the first page of the results is displayed. To see the rest
of the pages use <i>Next</i> and <i>Previous</i> buttons which can be found directly under the list.
In case you would like to display more publications per page, input the requested number of publications to the 
field below the list of publications.
<p/>
This part also includes buttons for adding, editing and deleting publications. The <i>Add publication</i> and
<i>Edit publication</i> buttons open the Add/Edit Publication Dialog (see below), the <i>Delete publication</strong>
button removes the publication after the confirmation. When <i>Edit</i> or </i>Delete</i>
button is pressed, publication must be selected in the list in order to proceed with the operation 
(otherwise the system will warn you that there is no publication selected). Adding and editing publications
is subject to the system of rights in plantlore. For more information on this topic, see the
appropriate help section.

<h3>The search criteria</h3>
Publication manager allows users to search the data using 4 parameters: Collection name, Journal name, 
Reference citation and Reference detail. Results can be ordered by Collction name, Publication year, 
Journal name, Journal author, Reference citation and Reference Detail in either 
ascending or descending direction. Search string for any of the parameters doesn't have to match 
the item in the database exactly and any substring will be sufficient (although it might yield more 
results). To start searching use <i>Search publications</i> button.
<p/>
The search is by default case insensitive.
<p/>
After the manager window is opened, all available publications are displayed. If you've executed a search
but you want to display and browse all available publications again, press the <i>Search publications</i>
button while all of the search fields are left blank.
