    <h1>Plantlore</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Plantlore is a plant occurrence database system that tries to solve the complex problem of occurrence data management.
The typical Plantlore user is an (almost) professional botanist. The user interface and the application desing concentrated
mainly on quality data entering, editing and data management as whole.</p>

<p>In the Plantlore system you won't therefore find features like data analysis, stats generation, it is not possible to store pictures with the occurrences.
On the other hand Plantlore works as a quite intelligent card-index (it is even possible to print the old fashioned cards - schedas). It tries to
make your occurrence data management easier - be it adding, editing, export or import, ...
Plantlore also isn't a taxonomical database. The database model of Plantlore however takes into account a possible future enhancement by interconnecting
it with some taxonomical database.</p>
<p>
<h2>The intended use of Plantlore</h2>
<p>The Plantlore system is designed for enviroment that has a central authority that manages all auxiliary data and that solves possible conflicts.
By auxiliary data we mean data other than the pure occurrence data. That for example means the list of taxons, list of territories, phythochoria or villages.
To make it possible to maintain such central management Plantlore has a system of rights thanks to that you can restrict access to some of it's functions to some users.
It is also assumed that in most cases the botanist works at home on a local computer not connected to the Internet. He usually exports his data and gives them to the central authority
that performs an import to a central database. </p>
<p>This is also why possible conflicts when two users would edit the same occurrence at the same time are solved "optimistically".
That means that it is assumed that conflicts are very rare and therfore it will be cheap to solve them manually. In practise that means that
if two users are editing the same occurrence at the same time only the first change appears in the database and the second user to click on Ok
will receive an error message. To make this, although rare, situation easier Plantlore has the feature of History. In the History you can
view all the changes that happend to the database and u can also perform undo operations.
</p>

<p>
<h2>The web client</h2>
<p>Except the normal GUI client Plantlore also contains a web client. The web client is expected to be installed only by the central authority in most cases.
This way the central authority can expose it's data to the public. Ordinary people then have access only to a limited amount of information
whereas the cooperating botanist can have full access. </p>
<p>Thanks to the web client it is also very easy to take part in the european research project BioCASE. You can find more information about this project on http://www.biocase.org/.
</p>
<h2>Beginning to work</h2>
<p>Usually after a successful install the user logs into the system locally, not using the Plantlore server. The database is after installation empty.
Therefore one of the first steps in newly installed Plantlore will be to import some of the auxiliary data. The user typically will
receive these data from his or her central authority and then import them using the command File -> Table import.</p>

<p>In case that the database contains data necessary to fill in all required fields it is possible to begin to add some new occurrence data
gained in the terrain. Therefore at least at the beginning the main commands of interest will be the Table import, Add and the managers in the Data menu.
