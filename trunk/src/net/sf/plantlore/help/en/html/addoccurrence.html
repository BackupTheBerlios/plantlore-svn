<title>Plantlore - Occurrence adding and editing</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Occurrence adding and editing</h1>
<p>You can do all basic occurrence manipulation from the Add and Edit dialogs.
You can edit only those records to which he has appropriate rights. To add a new occurrence
you also have to have sufficient rights.
</p>

<h2>1. Dialogs</h2>
<p>The add and edit dialogs are very similar in both their appearance and behaviour.
You can invoke both dialogs from the toolbar. There is one other way to invoke the Add dialog and that is from the <a href="habitattree.html">habitat tree</a>.
</p>
<br>

<p>
The dialog consists of three parts: location, occurrence (taxon/author) and table part. 
The table contains all occurrences contained in the given location. It is a help to make it easier for you
to keep track of what has already been added. You always have to input all required fields which are the ones denoted by a star.
After clicking on the Ok button new occurrence is added (or a present one updated). In case of adding a confirmation window shows up
after the operation is successfuly completed. The Add dialog remains on the screen open with all fields entered. This is to make it
easier to add other similar occurences that share most of the fields. <b>WARNING:</b> repeated clicking to the Ok button repeats the
insert of the same occurrence! You can use the two clear buttons to quickly clear the respective parts of the dialog.
</p>
<br>

<p>You can precisely specify the location of the occurrence using GPS coordinates. You can use one of the three supported coordinate systems:
S-JTSK, S42, WGS84. The base coordinate system is the WGS84. PLantlore automatically converts the coordinates before storing them into the database.
</p>

<p>The table of occurrences in the entered location. It shows information only about the author names the taxon name and the date.</p>

<h2>2. Editing an occurrence</h2>
<p>
    The edit dialog is quite powerful. While editing an occurrence you can delete an old one or even create new ones. The edit dialog
    determines the right actions according to what you fill in. Deleting an occurrence (which means deleting the taxon in the edit dialog)
    has the same effect as deleting in from the <a href="overview.html">Overview</a>. Adding new occurrences (which means entering new taxons in
    the edit dialog) has the same effect as adding them from the add dialog.
</p>

<h2>3. Disabling non-mandatory fields</h2>
<p>Often you won't want to fill in all the fields. In that case you can disable some of them
to enable quicker navigation through the dialog using keyboard. You can do that in the settings
dialog which you can invoke by clicking on the Settings button in the bottom part of the add or edit dialog.
</p>


<h2>4. Verification</h2>
<p>Plantlore automatically verifies the values you entered. Specifically it checks:
    <ul>
        <li>whether you filled in all required fields</li>
        <li>correctness of the date (whether it exists in gregorian calendar)</li>
        <li>value lenghts - for example the notes can be at most 4096 characters long</li>
        <li>value correctness - that there is a number where it is expected,etc. You have to adhere to the right decimal point character according to your current locale. In Czech locale it is a comma, in English locale it is a period.</li>
    </ul>        
</p>

<h2>5. Habitat sharing</h2>
<p>If you add multiple occurrences into a habitat all these occurrences wil share the habitat in the database model of Plantlore.
This means that Plantlore is able to recognize whish occurrences belong to which habitat. You can notice that
mainly when editing a shared habitat. In that case Plantlore will ask you whether you want to change the habitat
for all the occurrences or just for the one plant. The habitat is deleted when last it's occurrence is deleted.
</p>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Work with occurrences requires deliberation. When adding a new occurrence Plantlore automatically tries
      to find the entered location in the database. If it succeeds it uses that found habitat for the new occurrences.
      However, only a small difference for example in the place description will cause that Plantlore won't find the habitat
      and will create a new one instead. You'll be rewarded for dilligent work for example by bigger leverage of the <a href="habitattree.html">habitat tree</a>.
