/**
 * The Export task serves as a Director for the selected Builder.
 * It takes the supplied query, executes it, and hands over every
 * record, that is selected to be exported, to the Builder.
 * <br/>
 * The database layer is capable of retrieving whole records (objects)
 * from the database. 
 * Sometimes it may cost a lot of time to reconstruct the whole record and if we want
 * to export just a few columns, we would not use the rest of the record anyway.
 * This may lead to a great overhead. In order to reduce this overhead, projections can be used.
 * Projections is a list of columns the User wants to export; the list is typically very small.
 * The database layer is instructed to return only the values of those columns.
 * <br/>
 * Let's see an example:
 * <br/>
 * The User exports Occurrences and is interrested in three columns only:
 * Occurrence.UnitID, Occurrence.Plant.Taxon, Occurrence.Habitat.NearestVillage.Name.
 * It would not be wise to retrieve the whole record that comprises dozens of columns
 * some of which may contain a lot of data. We set those three projections and
 * instruct the Task to use them. The database layer will then return just those three values
 * for every record, then it will reconstruct the record from those values, 
 * and finally it will pass it to the Builder. This can speed up the Export enormously, 
 * especially when a remote connection is used.
 * <br/>
 * However, the usual use of Export is to export the whole record, 
 * therefore it is much more convenient to have the database layer 
 * reconstructed the object for us.
