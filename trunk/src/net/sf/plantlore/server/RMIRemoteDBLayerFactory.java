/**
 * RMIRemoteDBLayerFactory is responsible for management of Database Layers
 * on the remote machine. It can create and destroy them, it stores the list of
 * all created Database Layers (i.e. list of connected clients) and can disconnect the
 * selected client.
 * <br/>
 * It is a remote object so clients can connect to this factory and ask it to create 
 * a Database Layer for them.
 * <br/>
 * To stop the RMIRemoteDBLayerFactory properly, one must do the following steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Remove the RemoteDBLayerFactory from the rmiregistry, so that no more clients can obtain a reference
 * of the factory and ask it for creating a new dblayer</li>
 * <li>Unexport the RemoteDBLayerFactory, so that it cannot accept remote calls, so that all clients that
 * have a remote reference of this factory cannot ask it for another dblayer</li>
 * <li>"Kick" all currently connected users by unexporting their dblayer remote objects, 
 * which will terminate their connections for good.</li>
 * </ol>
