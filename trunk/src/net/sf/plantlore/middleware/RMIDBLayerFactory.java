 * The RMIDBLayerFactory can create and destroy DBLayers - either local or remote.

 * all the details how the DBLayer is created or where those objects really live.
 * <br/>
 * RMIDBLayer factory lives in the client's JVM.   
 * <br/>
 * The RMIDBLayerFactory keeps track of all database layers it has created and where they
