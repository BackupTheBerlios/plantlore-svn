/**
 * The RMIDBLayerFactory can create and destroy Database Layers (DBLayers in short) 
 * - either local or remote. 
 * The client should ask the factory to create the DBLayer and the factory will shield him from
 * all the details how the DBLayer is created or where those objects really live.
 * <br/>
 * The RMIDBLayerFactory keeps track of all database layers it has created and where they
 * actually live.
 * <table>
 * <tr><th></th><th>remote factory</th><th>database</th><th>stub</th><th>client</th></tr>
 * <tr><th>local</th><td>null</td><td>yes</td><td>null</td><td>"localhost (direct connection)"</td></tr>
 * <tr><th>stub</th><td>yes</td><td>null</td><td>yes</td><td>"localhost -> server name"</td></tr>
 * </table>
 * <br/>
 * The DBLayer factory is responsible for creating and destroying DBLayers.
 * It has no responsibility for initialization of those DBLayers.
 * <br/>
 * The RMIDBLayerFactory is a singleton.
