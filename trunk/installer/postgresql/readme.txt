* postgresql-int.msi - Installer for PostgreSQL Database system. IMPORTANT: This is just a dummy file (since we do not want to have Postgre installer in our repository. On the other hand, IzPack should be able to compile installer from freshly checked out working copy therefore we need some file here). If you want to build windows installer, substitute this file for real PostgreSQL installer (use file with -int suffix).

* postgre_intstall.bat - Script used for installing PostgreSQL database on Windows platform
